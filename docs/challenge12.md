# Challenge 12
### FizzBuzz!

FizzBuzz is a group word game to teach about division. Players take turns to
count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz",
and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".

Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to game_length on a new line. 
For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

### Function prototype:
    def fizz_buzz(game_length);
 
game_length (int): The number to play to, from 1 to game_length
 
### Return values
